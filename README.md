# elections
## First Segment Project Deliverable
- Write a python script to import elections datasets, then analyzing Data through graphs and apply deep-learning neural networks to analyze elections. Refer to [FinaProjects.ipynb](../hiep/FinaProjects.ipynb) and [FinaProjects.py](../hiep/FinaProjects.py)

## Challenge
- Run python script to import elections datasets([CostOfElection.csv](../hiep/Resources/CostOfElection.csv), [president_counties.csv](../hiep/Resources/president_counties.csv), [president_dataset.csv](../hiep/Resources/president_dataset.csv), and  [senate_dataset.csv](../hiep/Resources/senate_dataset.csv)).
- Analyzing Data through graphs and apply deep-learning neural networks. Refer to [Final Project Video](https://apple.box.com/shared/static/2bxkpq4rsgnuwto5ayy4syl222z79otu.m4v) for details.
- Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model with 1 hidden layer from  [senate_dataset.csv](../hiep/Resources/senate_dataset.csv). Refer to test result below:

- Add second hidden layer to increase model performance. Refer to test result below:

 ## Summary
 - Conclusion:  adding second hidden layer will increase model performance.
