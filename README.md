# Fourth Segment Project Deliverable
- Deploy machine learning model to the website for predicting the total votes and who will win the elections, also created the dashboard visualization for elections test results. Refer to [Our Website](https://predictsenate.anvil.app/) for details.
- Furthermore, deploy deep learning NeuralNetwork model to analyze vote turn out from [Elections Performance Index Dataset](../Hiep_3rd_Segment/Resources/epi.csv) and directly plot all the graphs on the web app. Refer to [Our WebApp](https://share.streamlit.io/hieppham8083/finalproject/main/main.py) for details.

- Deep learning to predict percentage of vote turn out from [epi.csv](../Hiep_3rd_Segment/Resources/epi.csv). Refer to [EPI_NeuraulNetwork.ipynb](../Hiep_3rd_Segment/Machine_Learning/epi_nn.ipynb) for details.
- Database sections: Wrote a script to store data to SQL_database. Refer to [Dataframe_to_sql.ipynb](../hiep/Dataframe_to_sql.ipynb)
