# U.S. Senate Cammpaign Spending Analysis

## Topic

For our final group project, we are examining the relationship between how much money is spent by United States Senate campaigns, how the campaigns spend their money, and the success of these campaigns.

We are interested in how often the Senate candidate that spends the most wins the election, but also *how* the campaigns spend their funds. Some examples of how campaigns spend their money include staff salaries, advertising expenses, travel expenses, and campaign materials.

We will measure success in multiple ways including whether or not the Senate candidates win their campaigns, but also how well they do relative to expectations.

## Reason for Topic

In recent years, U.S. federal election campaign spending has exploded. In 2020, [nearly $14 billion](https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/SENATE-FUNDRAISING/yxmvjeyjkpr/) was spent across the House, Senate, and Presidential races. This is roughly double the amount spent on the previous presidential election cycle in 2016.

While this influx of cash gives campaigns the flexibility to spend in ways and amounts previously unavailable, it's also resulted in a campaign finance "arms race" where the opposing candidates often have the same flexibility. It remains critical for campaigns to allocate resources wisely.

So, we want to examine not only to what degree campaign spending influences election outcomes, but also what types of spending are most effective.
