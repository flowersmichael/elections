## Third Segment Project Deliverable
- Deploy machine learning model to the website for predicting the total votes and who will win the elections, also created the dashboard for elections test results. Refer to [Our Website](https://predictsenate.anvil.app/) for details.
- Furthermore, deploy deep learning neural network model to analyze Senate dataset, and directly plot all the graphs on the web app. Refer to [Our WebApp](https://share.streamlit.io/hieppham8083/finalproject/main/main.py) for details.

## Challenge
- Depp learning neural network model step by step:
