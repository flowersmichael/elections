# U.S. Senate Cammpaign Spending Analysis

## Topic

For our final group project, we are examining the relationship between how much money is spent by United States Senate campaigns, how the campaigns spend their money, and the success of these campaigns. How and to what extent does money affect elections?

Advertising is the major expense of political campaigns, with recent U.S. Senate campaigns spending roughly 40% of funds on ads. Within this realm of political advertising, political donations can be classified as either "hard money" or "soft money" contributions.

Hard money comes from political donations that are regulated by law by the Federal Election Commission, versus "soft money" that is donated in such a way that leaves the contribution unregulated. Soft money donations can be used for "party building" activities, but these funds cannot be used to tell voters which candidates to vote for. Hard money contributions, on the other hand, are spent on ads that either directly support or oppose a specific candidate.

For the purposes of this project, we are strictly concerned with "hard money" political donations. 

We will measure success in multiple ways including whether or not the Senate candidates win their campaigns, but also how well they do relative to expectations.


## Reason for Interest

In recent years, U.S. federal election campaign spending has exploded. In 2020, [nearly $14 billion](https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/SENATE-FUNDRAISING/yxmvjeyjkpr/) was spent across the House, Senate, and Presidential races. This is roughly double the amount spent on the previous presidential election cycle in 2016.

While this influx of cash gives campaigns the flexibility to spend in ways and amounts previously unavailable, it's also resulted in a campaign finance "arms race" where the opposing candidates often have the same flexibility. It remains critical for campaigns to allocate resources wisely.

So, we want to examine not only to what degree campaign spending influences election outcomes, but also what types of spending are most effective.


## Data Sources

We rely primarily on two data sources for the project.

The first source is titled [U.S. Senate 1976-2020](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PEJ5QU), from MIT Election Data and Science Lab. This dataset shows state-level returns for U.S. Senate elections from 1976-2020.

Our second dataset is Federal Election Commission (FEC) data via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fec/independent-political-ad-spending). This dataset shows campaign spending for U.S. Senate, House of Representatives, and Presidential elections between 2002-2016.


## Questions to Answer

How much does each additional dollar spent by campaigns relative to other campaigns impact the candidate's win probability?

What is the optimal asset allocation of campaign dollars in terms of spending categories?

Does this asset allocation prescription vary by subgroups of U.S. states with similar demographic profiles?

Given a baseline expectation of candidate performance, how well can we predict candidate performance using our independent variables?


## Team Communication

Outside of the Tuesday and Thursday night classes, we will meet over video conference at least once per week to coordinate and plan.

Additionally, we will be communicating regularly via our group Slack channel, and group text as well.
